Overall Trends:
* Petroleum remains the largest energy source consumed, with a slight upward trend from about 35 quadrillion BTU in 1980 to around 37 quadrillion BTU by 2030.
* Natural Gas shows significant growth, from about 20 quadrillion BTU in 1980 to around 32 quadrillion BTU by 2030.
* Coal has a slow and steady upward trend, from about 15 quadrillion BTU in 1980 to around 22 quadrillion BTU by 2030.
* Nuclear energy remains relatively stable, fluctuating around 8 quadrillion BTU throughout the period.
* Renewables show growth, especially in the projected period, from about 3 quadrillion BTU in 1980 to around 12 quadrillion BTU by 2030.

Key Data Points:
* In 2008, petroleum accounted for about 37 quadrillion BTU, natural gas about 24 quadrillion BTU, coal about 22 quadrillion BTU, nuclear about 8 quadrillion BTU, and renewables about 7 quadrillion BTU.
* Projected for 2030, petroleum is expected to account for about 37 quadrillion BTU, natural gas about 32 quadrillion BTU, coal about 22 quadrillion BTU, nuclear about 8 quadrillion BTU, and renewables about 12 quadrillion BTU.
* Petroleum has always been the largest energy source consumed throughout the period.

Significant Changes:
* Significant growth of natural gas, especially from 2000 onwards.
* Growth of renewables in the projected period 2008-2030.
